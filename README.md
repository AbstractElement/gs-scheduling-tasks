This guide walks you through the steps for scheduling tasks with Spring.

What you'll build
-----------------

You'll build an application the prints out the current time every five seconds using Spring's `@Scheduled` annotation.

What you'll need
----------------

 - About 15 minutes
 - A favorite text editor or IDE
 - [JDK 6][jdk] or later
 - [Gradle 1.7+][gradle] or [Maven 3.0+][mvn]
 - You can also import the code from this guide as well as view the web page directly into [Spring Tool Suite (STS)][gs-sts] and work your way through it from there.

How to complete this guide
--------------------------

Like all Spring's [Getting Started guides](/guides/gs), you can start from scratch and complete each step, or you can bypass basic setup steps that are already familiar to you. Either way, you end up with working code.

To **start from scratch**, move on to [Set up the project](#scratch).

To **skip the basics**, do the following:

 - [Download][zip] and unzip the source repository for this guide, or clone it using [Git][u-git]:
`git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks.git`
 - cd into `gs-scheduling-tasks/initial`.
 - Jump ahead to [Create a scheduled task](#initial).

**When you're finished**, you can check your results against the code in `gs-scheduling-tasks/complete`.

Set up the project
------------------

First you set up a basic build script. You can use any build system you like when building apps with Spring, but the code you need to work with [Gradle](http://gradle.org) and [Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is included here. If you're not familiar with either, refer to [Building Java Projects with Gradle](/guides/gs/gradle/) or [Building Java Projects with Maven](/guides/gs/maven).

### Create the directory structure

In a project directory of your choosing, create the following subdirectory structure; for example, with `mkdir -p src/main/java/hello` on *nix systems:

    └── src
        └── main
            └── java
                └── hello


### Create a Gradle build file
Below is the [initial Gradle build file](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks/blob/master/initial/build.gradle). But you can also use Maven. The pom.xml file is included [right here](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks/blob/master/initial/pom.xml). If you are using [Spring Tool Suite (STS)][gs-sts], you can import the guide directly.

`build.gradle`
```gradle
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
        mavenLocal()
    }
}

apply plugin: 'java'
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
apply plugin: 'idea'

jar {
    baseName = 'gs-scheduling-tasks'
    version =  '0.1.0'
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
    maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
}

dependencies {
    compile("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter:0.5.0.M4")
    testCompile("junit:junit:4.11")
}

task wrapper(type: Wrapper) {
    gradleVersion = '1.7'
}
```

Create a scheduled task
-----------------------
Now that you've set up your project, you can create a scheduled task.

`src/main/java/hello/ScheduledTasks.java`
```java
package hello;

import java.text.SimpleDateFormat;
import java.util.Date;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.EnableScheduling;
import org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.Scheduled;

@EnableScheduling
public class ScheduledTasks {

    private static final SimpleDateFormat dateFormat = new SimpleDateFormat("HH:mm:ss");

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 5000)
    public void reportCurrentTime() {
        System.out.println("The time is now " + dateFormat.format(new Date()));
    }
}
```

The key components that make this code perform scheduled tasks are the `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` annotations. 

`@EnableScheduling` ensures that a background task executor is created. Without it, nothing gets scheduled. 

You use `@Scheduled` to configure when a particular method is run.
> **Note:** This example uses `fixedRate`, which specifies the interval between method invocations measured from the start time of each invocation. There are [other options](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html#scheduling-annotation-support-scheduled), like `fixedDelay`, which specifies the interval between invocations measured from the completion of the task. You can also [use `@Scheduled(cron=". . .")` expressions for more sophisticated task scheduling](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/3.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html).


Make the application executable
-------------------------------

Although scheduled tasks can be embedded in web apps and WAR files, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method.

### Create an application class

Here you create a new `SpringApplication` and run it with the `ScheduledTasks` you defined earlier. This action creates a task executor and allows tasks to be scheduled."

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
```java
package hello;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;

public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        SpringApplication.run(ScheduledTasks.class);
    }
}
```

### Build an executable JAR

Now that your `Application` class is ready, you simply instruct the build system to create a single, executable jar containing everything. This makes it easy to ship, version, and deploy the service as an application throughout the development lifecycle, across different environments, and so forth.

Below are the Gradle steps, but if you are using Maven, you can find the updated pom.xml [right here](https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks/blob/master/complete/pom.xml) and build it by typing `mvn clean package`.

Update your Gradle `build.gradle` file's `buildscript` section, so that it looks like this:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        maven { url "http://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot" }
        mavenLocal()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-gradle-plugin:0.5.0.M4")
    }
}
```

Further down inside `build.gradle`, add the following to the list of applied plugins:

```groovy
apply plugin: 'spring-boot'
```
You can see the final version of `build.gradle` [right here]((https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-scheduling-tasks/blob/master/complete/build.gradle).

The [Spring Boot gradle plugin][spring-boot-gradle-plugin] collects all the jars on the classpath and builds a single "über-jar", which makes it more convenient to execute and transport your service.
It also searches for the `public static void main()` method to flag as a runnable class.

Now run the following command to produce a single executable JAR file containing all necessary dependency classes and resources:

```sh
$ ./gradlew build
```

If you are using Gradle, you can run the JAR by typing:

```sh
$ java -jar build/libs/gs-scheduling-tasks-0.1.0.jar
```

If you are using Maven, you can run the JAR by typing:

```sh
$ java -jar target/gs-scheduling-tasks-0.1.0.jar
```

[spring-boot-gradle-plugin]: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/spring-boot-tools/spring-boot-gradle-plugin

> **Note:** The procedure above will create a runnable JAR. You can also opt to [build a classic WAR file](/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war/) instead.


Run the service
-------------------
If you are using Gradle, you can run your service at the command line this way:

```sh
$ ./gradlew clean build && java -jar build/libs/gs-scheduling-tasks-0.1.0.jar
```

> **Note:** If you are using Maven, you can run your service by typing `mvn clean package && java -jar target/gs-scheduling-tasks-0.1.0.jar`.


Logging output is displayed. You should see your scheduled task fire every 5 seconds:

```sh
[...]
The time is now 13:10:00
The time is now 13:10:05
The time is now 13:10:10
The time is now 13:10:15
```

Summary
-------

Congratulations! You created an application with a scheduled task. Heck, the actual code was shorter than the build file! This technique works in any type of application.
